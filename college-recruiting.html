        The college recruiting process is more competitive than ever. With thousands of high school players pursuing limited roster 
        spots, families need clarity, strategy, and accurate data to navigate the journey. Our approach blends real recruiting

        <h3>A Smarter Way to Navigate College Recruiting</h3>
        <p class="wide-text">
          Over the past five years, the gap between potential college soccer players and those who actually secure roster spots has 
          widened. Understanding where you stand — and how to stand out — is essential. This page gives you the tools, insights, and 
          structure to do exactly that.

      <h2 class="section-title">Why So Many Players Never Reach College or Professional Levels</h2>

      <p class="wide-text" style="max-width:900px; margin:auto;">
        Despite years of training, competition, and commitment, the majority of youth players never transition into college or 
        professional soccer. The issue isn’t talent — it’s the lack of a structured pathway, strategic guidance, and understanding 
        of the hidden layers of development and recruiting. Without clarity, families make decisions too late, players train the 
        wrong areas, and coaches lack the bandwidth to guide every individual. The result is predictable: frustration, burnout, 
        and missed opportunities.
      </p>

      <div class="floating-cards-grid" style="margin-top:50px;">
        <div class="floating-card">
          <h3>Late Understanding of the Recruiting Timeline</h3>
          <p>Most families don’t realize the process starts years before they expect — often by freshman year.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="floating-card">
          <h3>Lack of Tactical & Cognitive Development</h3>
          <p>Players train technically but rarely develop the decision‑making and intelligence college coaches prioritize.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="floating-card">
          <h3>Poor Highlight Video Structure</h3>
          <p>Most highlight videos fail to show real value, leading coaches to skip over talented players.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="floating-card">
          <h3>No Strategy for Coach Communication</h3>
          <p>Players don’t know what to say, when to say it, or how to stand out in a crowded inbox.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="floating-card">
          <h3>Unclear Program Fit</h3>
          <p>Families chase big‑name schools instead of identifying the right athletic, academic, and cultural fit.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="floating-card">
          <h3>Zero Guidance on Scholarship Pathways</h3>
          <p>Most players don’t understand scholarship tiers, negotiations, or how limited athletic money truly is.</p>

        Futbol IQ Academy was built to solve these problems. We provide a modern, data‑driven system that gives players, parents,

      <h2 class="section-title fade-up">Recruiting Skills Training Grid</h2>

      <p class="wide-text fade-up" style="max-width:900px; margin:auto;">
        The Recruiting Skills Training Grid breaks the entire recruiting journey into clear, trainable components. Instead of guessing 
        what matters or reacting too late, players learn the exact skills that drive exposure, communication, evaluation, and 
        opportunity — all structured into a roadmap they can follow with confidence.
      </p>

      <p class="wide-text fade-up" style="max-width:900px; margin:20px auto 0;">
        Each skill in the grid directly impacts a player's ability to stand out: stronger communication, smarter highlight videos, 
        better academic positioning, clearer program fit, and a deeper understanding of what college coaches actually evaluate. 
        When players master these skills, their recruiting outcomes improve dramatically — more responses, more interest, more 
        opportunities.
      </p>

      <p class="wide-text fade-up" style="max-width:900px; margin:20px auto 0;">
        Through our proprietary FIQA Recruiting Intelligence System, players gain access to structured training that accelerates 
        their recruiting readiness. This system helps players build the clarity, confidence, and strategy needed to unlock college 
        pathways that once felt out of reach.
