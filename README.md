## 🎨 Aesthetic System (Gradient‑Modular)

The site uses a **modular gradient system** to create a premium, modern rhythm across pages.

### **Core Gradient Classes**
These classes are defined in `styles.css`:

```css
.gradient-hero        /* Solana-style animated gradient */
.gradient-dark        /* Clean dark sections for readability */
.gradient-blue-teal   /* Pricing + Standard Analysis accent */
.gradient-pink-purple /* Contact + Advanced Analysis accent */
